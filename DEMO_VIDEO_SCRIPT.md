### [0:00-0:15] HOOK & INTRO

**On screen**: Title "Sprint Kit" with rocket emoji

**Voiceover**:
"This is Sprint Kit. An AI project planner built for middle schoolers.

But it's not just another tool. It teaches four real skills during the one moment kids' brains are most ready to learn them."

**Visual**: Show title + quick flash of all 7 steps

### [0:15-0:45] THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

**On screen**: Split screen - "Adult Project Tools" vs "How Kids Think"

**Voiceover**:
"Most project planning tools use adult jargon like 'deliverables,' 'stakeholders,' and 'synergy.'

[Show confusing jargon on screen]

Twelve to fourteen-year-olds don't understand that language. And there's a bigger problem: this is THE window—ages 12 to 15—when kids develop metacognitive ability. The ability to think about their own thinking.

[Show brain image or graphic]

If we don't teach real project planning skills NOW, it's harder later."

### [0:45-1:30] THE SOLUTION IN ACTION (45 seconds)

**On screen**: Recording of the 7-step flow

**Voiceover**:
"Sprint Kit guides students through 7 steps. Real steps that teach real skills.

[Show Step 1] First, students define their project. In plain language. 'I want to build a robot.'

[Show Step 2] Then they brainstorm. Ideas, no judgment.

[Show Step 3] They set a goal. What does done look like?

[Show Step 4] Then here's where it gets interesting. AI breaks the project into tasks. But students don't just accept it—they edit it. They practice decomposition. Breaking big goals into manageable steps.

[Show editing tasks]

[Show Step 5] They assign tasks to teammates. The system checks: 'Is the workload fair? Does the timeline make sense?'

[Show Step 6] Then—and this is critical—they reflect. Not just 'was it fun?' but 'what did I learn about how I work?'

The AI generates insights based on their reflection.

[Show insights appearing]

[Show Step 7] Finally, they export a PDF. A real project plan they can share with parents, teachers, or keep as a portfolio piece."

### [1:30-2:00] WHY IT WORKS (30 seconds)

**On screen**: Gold Standard PBL framework diagram or text

**Voiceover**:
"Sprint Kit is grounded in Gold Standard Project-Based Learning—a framework educators have used for 30 years.

Every feature aligns with real learning principles:
- Students ask real questions (what should we build?)
- They sustain inquiry (7 steps, not a one-off)
- They work with authenticity (real projects, real teams)
- They have voice and choice (they decide what to build)
- They reflect deeply (metacognition happens here)
- They get public feedback (teammates, teachers, family)
- They create real products (PDF they can share)

[Show badges appearing]

We celebrate real learning with badges. Not points for clicking buttons. Badges for demonstrating actual skills. Decomposition. Time estimation. Collaboration.

Research shows middle schoolers detect manipulation. Authentic badges for real learning? That works."

---

### [2:00-2:25] THE IMPACT (25 seconds)

**On screen**: Student testimonial-style graphics or simple text

**Voiceover**:
"When students learn project planning during this critical window, something shifts.

They become better planners. Better collaborators. Better at thinking about how they think.

These skills transfer. To college. To careers. To life.

And they learn them at exactly the moment their brains are built to absorb them.

[Show all 7 steps one more time, fast]

That's not just a tool. That's educational responsibility."

---

### [2:25-2:30] OUTRO (5 seconds)

**On screen**: Sprint Kit logo, GitHub link, DevPost link

**Voiceover**:
"Sprint Kit. Plan your project. Learn real skills.

[GitHub link appears]
[DevPost link appears]

Made for the CS Girlies 'Make Learning Cool Again' hackathon."

## RECORDING TIPS

✅ **Slow down screen recordings** - Viewers need time to read  
✅ **Use clear microphone** - Script is dense with info  
✅ **Show the interface**, not just code  
✅ **Emphasize the 7 steps** - That's your core value  
✅ **Mention "Gold Standard PBL" once** - Signals you did homework  
✅ **Show badges** - Visual proof of authentic gamification  
✅ **No fancy edits needed** - Clear > perfect

## ALTERNATIVE OPENING (If you want energy)

Instead of [0:00-0:15]:

**Voiceover**:
"What if there was a project planner that actually teaches kids how to plan? Not through games. Through real learning."

*(Show quick 3-second montage of the 7 steps)*

"This is Sprint Kit."

## SCRIPT NOTES FOR VOICEOVER

- **Pace**: Slightly slower than normal (people are reading)
- **Tone**: Enthusiastic but not hype-y (educational, not salesy)
- **Energy**: Build through the "problem," peak at "solution," close strong with impact
- **Emphasis**: "Real learning," "Gold Standard PBL," "badges for real skills," "metacognition"
