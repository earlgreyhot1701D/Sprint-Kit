# Sprint Kit - Privacy Policy
**Simple, Honest, Kid-Friendly**

---

## TL;DR (The Short Version)

Sprint Kit does **not** collect, store, or sell your data. When you close your browser, everything you did disappears. We don't track you, show you ads, or share anything with anyone.

**That's it. That's the policy.** â™»ï¸

## THE FULL STORY (For Parents & Teachers)

### **What Is Sprint Kit?**

Sprint Kit is a free AI-powered project planner designed for middle school students (grades 6-8). It helps students learn how to break down big goals into tasks, estimate time, work with teams, and reflect on what they learned.

---

## WHAT WE COLLECT

### **The Honest Answer: Almost Nothing**

When you use Sprint Kit, we collect:

- **Your project information** (only while you're using the app)
  - Project title, description, goals
  - Tasks you create or edit
  - Team member names (first names only)
  - Your reflection text
  - Badges earned

**That's literally all.**

### **What We DO NOT Collect**

- âŒ Your real name or full name
- âŒ Email addresses
- âŒ Phone numbers
- âŒ Home address
- âŒ Age or birthdate
- âŒ School name
- âŒ Cookies or tracking codes
- âŒ Behavior tracking (clicks, time spent, etc.)
- âŒ IP addresses (not logged)
- âŒ Device information
- âŒ Location data
- âŒ Anything else that identifies you

## WHEN DATA GETS DELETED

### **The Timeline**

**Your data is automatically deleted when:**

1. You close your browser tab
2. You refresh the page
3. 24 hours pass (even if you don't close it)
4. You click "Clear my data" button in the app

**We don't have a database storing your information.** Everything is temporary, in-memory, on your device. When it's gone, it's *really* gone.

---

## WHY WE DON'T COLLECT DATA

### **The Philosophy**

We believe:
- Students have a right to privacy
- Apps shouldn't manipulate you with tracking data
- Schools should own their learning data, not tech companies
- Building trust is more important than building profiles

That's why we built Sprint Kit to collect basically nothing.

## HOW WE USE CLAUDE AI

### **You Should Know:**

Sprint Kit uses Claude (made by Anthropic) to help break down your project into tasks.

**Here's what happens:**

1. You enter your project description
2. We send it to Claude's API
3. Claude suggests tasks for your project
4. We show you the suggestions
5. Claude doesn't store your project (they don't save it either)
6. You can edit suggestions or create your own

**Claude's Privacy:** Anthropic doesn't use your project data to train their AI or build customer profiles. See their privacy policy: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

**You can use Sprint Kit without Claude:** If you prefer, you can skip the AI suggestions and create your own task list.

## WHAT ABOUT THE PDF I DOWNLOAD?

### **That's Your File**

When you export your project as a PDF:
- You download it to your computer
- We don't keep a copy
- We don't know what you do with it
- That's your property

Same with text export (copy to clipboard). We never touch it after you download.
